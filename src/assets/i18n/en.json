    "text":"In a distant land, behind the Parole mountains, far from the lands of Vocalia and Consonantia, random lyrics live. They live isolated in the town of Lettere, on the shores of the Semantic, an immense linguistic ocean. A small stream called Devoto Oli runs through those places, supplying them with all the regulations they need. It is a paradismatic land, a land of plenty where greedy portions of roasted propositions fly into the mouth of those who want them. Not once have random texts been dominated by the almighty punctuation, a truly non-spelling life. But one day it happened that the small line of a random text, named Lorem ipsum, decided to go and explore the vast Grammar. The great Oximox tried to dissuade her, as the place was teeming with ruthless commas, wild question marks, and devious semicolons, but the random little text was certainly not misled. He picked up his seven capital letters, slipped his initial into his belt, and set out. When he passed the first hills of the Corsivi mountains, he turned to look one last time at the skyline of Lettere, his city, the headline of the Alphabet village and the subline of his own street, the Riga alley. A rhetorical question"
